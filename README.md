Data Engineer Test

Thank you for the opportunity to do this task. I had not used APIs in this way so if 
I had had more time I would have liked to have refined the code for api endpoints.

To improve the method I would have also liked to robustly tested the api endpoints using either Postman or Swagger - I have included swaggertest.py as to how I would have set this out.

I enjoyed this and learnt a lot, so thank you!
